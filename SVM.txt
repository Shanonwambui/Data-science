SVM
Support Vector Machine‚Äù (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification or regression challenges.
We are using the SVM algorithm for regression. The train test split is used to evaluate the performance of our algorithm. The accuracy score function
calculates the accuracy score for the set of predicted labels against the true labels.
